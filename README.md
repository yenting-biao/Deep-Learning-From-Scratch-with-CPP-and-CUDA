# Deep Learning From Scratch with C++ and CUDA
This repository contains the code for implementing deep learning algorithms from scratch using pure C++ and CUDA. It is the final project of Group 34 for the Parallel Programming course at National Taiwan University.

## How to Run

Ensure that CUDA is installed in your environment. Then, execute the following commands:
```bash
make
./regression.out
```
This will start the training process for the example training code we provided. You can modify the hyperparameters and model architecture in the code as needed. As for the key points to use this simplified deep learning framework, please refer to our report.

## Dataset Source

[Szeged Weather](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/budincsevity/szeged-weather)

Predict the apparent temperature based on the humidity of the day, and the humidity, temperature, and apparent temperature of the previous three hours.
